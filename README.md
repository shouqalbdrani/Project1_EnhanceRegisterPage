# Project1_EnhanceRegisterPage
Project Overview:
I worked on developing a Company Registration Form. The goal was to create a user interface for company registration with data validation using JavaScript, improve the layout, and ensure that required fields were properly filled out.

Setup Instructions:
Create HTML file:
The structure of the form was created inside an HTML file, which includes various fields such as company name, commercial registration number, email, phone number, city , region , zip code , password, confirm password, business type, and terms agreement.

CSS style
For the web I try to download the tailwind from the extension in visual studio code and add import for tailwind in css file.

Create JavaScript file:
The JavaScript code for handling the registration form was included in a separate file. This code includes the logic for data validation and the implementation of various functions.

Ensure usage of additional files or libraries:
I ensured that all required fields are validated before submitting the form using JavaScript to ensure the entered data is correct.

Data validation:
Added data validation using JavaScript to ensure that the required fields are filled out correctly before allowing form submission.
Error display:
If any field has an issue (such as mismatched passwords or an empty field), an error message is displayed below the respective field to help the user correct their input.

Feature implemented is Rsponsive layout , Dynamic form field , API integration , Add animation for the page , Error handling.
